# Notes for teacher:
## Tested in Firefox, Chrome as well as a PWA, it also works on all browsers except for Internet Explorer, Opera Mini and KaiOS Browser. In other words, it should work even on safari. You can take pictures even when disabling position, the picture location will render as: "User did not allow position" The app locates the closest city / town when you take a picture when allowing geolocation.

### Bug: 1. The first press of "take picture" will not work, i.e, press the button twice when first using the application. 2. When trying to remove 1 picture when saving pictures without location allowed, it delets all the pictures. However, removing one picture at a time still works when saved pictures has a location in them..
