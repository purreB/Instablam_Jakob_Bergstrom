## Quick thoughts: Start by saving the gallery in localStorage, to get the date of when the picture was taken, add a date.now() function to when you press "Take pic" and save it together with the picture.
### In other words, gallery is array of objects, inside every obj is properties: Picture, Date, Position. Or maybe save array of obj inside a state? However i think localStorage works best
